        <p>Ok, so this is not really a virus</p>
        <p>This is just a page that I made for installing random files I decide to put here</p>
        <p>You can leave if you want.</p>
        <p>but since you were brave enough to make it past the virus page</p>
        <p>you might as well stay and browse</p>
